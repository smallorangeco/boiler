Boiler
======

A small kickstart skeleton for Restful applications with Express.js and Angular.js

It included my favorite libs, with my favorite dir tree:

* Bluebird {for Promises}
* Handlebars {for Server side templates}
* Express Subdomain {to handle API subdomains}
* Lodash
* Multer {for file stream upload, is a top level layer for busboy lib}
* Passport {for Authentication}
* Passport-local {for User/Pass Authentication}
* Passport-htt-bearer {for API Authentication => Web Token}
* Grunt to automate tasks
* Bower
* An custom error page which can be hit with => {http://localhost/error?title=Error Demo&text=Its a bad error}

## It's completely raw, I mean, at blue point!!!! Have a good day, and code hard [:
